# why automated testing why TDD
1. we write test to PROVE your code does what you THINK it does
2. tests help define the problem your are trying to solve
3. test help you verify that new chnages or refactors dont break the rest of your code




```ruby
def get_age(year_of_birth,current_year)
   # find out the current  year
   # current_year - year_of_birth

end
test(8,2010,2018)
```
